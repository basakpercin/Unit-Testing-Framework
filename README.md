– Developed a custom JUnit-like testing framework, enabling execution of test cases within a class and re-
turning results as a map of test names to outcomes (exceptions/errors or null for passes).
– Extended the framework to support QuickCheck-style testing, running test cases with a range of random
parameters and tracking failures.
Did this projects as a part of Tufts Software Engineering course
